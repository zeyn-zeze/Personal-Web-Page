Name-Surname:Zeynep Ozcelik
School-ID : 220229034

This website was created with HTML and external CSS codes in Visual Studio Code editor.
Given conditions were paid attention to in HTML and CSS codes.
In addition, this website had been tried to semantic web rules.

On the HTML side of the website,
My Html section consist of 3 part.The first part,"website was started with <h1></h1> and was occured a head of the website."<p> </p>" (paragraph tag) is used to indicate the paragraph in which I was talking about myself.
Paragraph tags were used to for appear organised image and paragraphs.And <section> and <div> tags were made the website look more organized.And This tags are more important for The Semantic Web Rules.
In the first <div>, The information given by me about myself was mentioned.And was added a image.
In the Second <div>,If the readers want to know more information about the paragraph,link was put on the website with <a></a> tag."target=_blank" has been used to for link page open in the other page.

In second section, 
I mentioned my hobbies and i put some images about my hobbies.My hobbies were list with <ul> and <li> tags.For images and list seems beautiful,images and lists were seperate with <div> tags.
Images and list were classified with this type:
1-Image1, 2- Lists ,3-Image2
Image and list seems more organised were tend to box speficies in CSS more than HTML.

In the final section on the HTML,
Some form,checkbox were made for  get information about the reader and learn about her/him hobbies.This form consist of 3 tags:<input type="text">,<input type="checkbox">,<input type="radio">.Text was used for know readers name, get information about reader and get reader's hobbies.
checkbox type was used for which hobby common with mine. and radio button created in case the reader is interested in coding.I wrote all form and checkbox in <footer> side.
<Table>, <tr>, <td> tags are used to make the text and checkboxes look separate and more organized.

On the CSS side of the web site,
CSS side is used for HTML side look more organised and colorful.Some Css tags like color,background color,margin,text-aline,display,box-size,font-size,font-style were used for give shape to body side of HTML.
Ids(#) and classes (.) are used to make special adjustments within certain fields.For example ın the second section's div part we used "class=col-3",ın css side looked  like this:

.col-3
{
   
    display: inline-block;
    width: calc(50% - 2px);
    height: 350px;
    vertical-align:text-top;
    font-size: 24px;
    list-style-type:square;
    margin:0 auto;
    font-style:italic;
    font-weight: bold;
    color:#F9F2ED;
}

I have 10 class and 2 id on my website for using in CSS.
First, I used body{}; for background image fill the whole page.
I used h1{}; for set the background, place on the page, layout, size and type of the font of the h1 tag in the HTML.
I used .paragraph1{} for the first paragraph's background colour, color,position,font style etc. to determine.
I used .col-2{} for arrange width ,height between paragraph and image and for create a block between paragraphs and image with display="inline-block".
Then, I used "web" class for make a design on the link.I used ".web,.web:link,.web:visited,.web:hover,.web:active" for change properties when before clicking on the link, after clicking it,clicking.
I used h3{}; for make a title in the hobbies part and i designed background and font-colour.I arranged font-size,style,where will the text be with text-align.then,i put a border around the header for the look more organised.
I used  .col_3{} for arrange unordered list's style and size of the list box, font-size,arrange the spacing left outside the page and inside the box.
I used #box_2 id for use the features fill the whole hobbies part(with h3),features like margin,padding,background color,color.
I used #box_3 id for change background color and arrange space between form-box and page with using margin.(addition,I used padding too for page look more organised.) 
I used #tell_me_hobbies for the final selection h3's part's decoration.I wanted  make the h3's background different from #box_3(form-box) and ı changed colour and text design with bacground colour for looking more pretty.
I used  div img{}; for arrange the image width and hight and the place where i put image in first section.
I used .img2{},.img3{}; for arrange width,height,margin and padding of the images.
Towards the end I used input[type="checkbox"], input[type=radio].I just arranged margin and padding.I set the range of the content with padding and box.
Final I used table,td for seperate all boxes with border.Table made it easy to separate forms.I used border,margin to make table look clear.

And generally I used display="block" or "inline-block" all of them especially id which include a box and some of class.Because I wanted to my web site's look classified and organised.
i could distinguish my webpage's components through this property.And I could add diffirent features like background-color,color,margin,padding,text-align etc.for different boxes.
 
I had a hard time dividing the page into sections with box, and finally I assigned different box ids to each section.Also, I wanted to put different background-image to each section but i was forced for "display="block""command seperate all div,p,img,id,class.
Eventually,I decided put a one background-color whole body of the HTML.

I didn't take my photos internet ,You can only access with "images" folder in the "WEBSITE/website_homework" folder.
